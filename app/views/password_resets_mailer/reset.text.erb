<%= @user.first_name %>,

someone made a request to reset your account password. To do so follow this link:
  
<%= edit_password_reset_url @user.send(Authorizable.configuration.password_reset_token_column_name) %>
  
(If you did not request your password to be reset you can safely ignore this email and your password will stay as it is.)
